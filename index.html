      <h3>Religion</h3>
      <p> I believe in Christianity and I attend Bethel Christian Ministries. I have been going here for about eight months and I have been surrounded by the love and joy of God ever since. I've learned so much about how to follow God and live my life like him. God is my number one. 
      </p>

      <p>Bethel has been around for about 20 years and is still a solid foundation to worship the Lord. My friends introduced me to the church and I've been a memeber ever since. The pastor of the church is named Justin Anthony. To learn more about the church and what it stands for, click here

      <h3>School</h3>
      <p>I have attended OVS (Omaha Virtual School) for 4 years now. I met so many amazing people and built so many close friendships through this school. I have many resources that are there to help and supoort me if I need it, and I know that the people there care deeply about what they do. It takes a lot of self discipline and obedience to excel in this program but once you master a healthy routine and advocate for yourself when you need help, you will do very well in this program. The mascot for my school is an ocelot and it is located at the TAC building. Below is there website to learn more about their program.
